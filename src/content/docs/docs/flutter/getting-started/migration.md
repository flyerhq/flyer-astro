title: Migration from v1 ðŸ”„

:::danger[Major Rewrite!]
Flyer Chat v2 is a significant departure from v1. While this guide covers key breaking changes in models and the `Chat` widget, expect to refactor other areas of your implementation as well. Direct migration is not possible.

For additional insights into migrating your Firebase application with Flyer Chat v2, please refer to the discussion and resources available in this GitHub issue: [flyerhq/flutter_chat_ui#750](https://github.com/flyerhq/flutter_chat_ui/issues/750).
:::

This document highlights the most critical breaking changes to help you get started:
*   Key updates to the core data models.
*   Changes to the required parameters for the main `Chat` widget.

While this won't cover every difference, understanding these core changes is the essential first step in adapting your v1 codebase.

## Message Model Changes

*   **`author` -> `authorId`**: v2 now resolves user objects based on their ID.
*   **`createdAt`**: Type changed from `int` to `DateTime`. It serializes to milliseconds UTC timestamp in JSON.
*   **`status`**: Replaced by a combination of optional `DateTime?` fields (`deletedAt`, `failedAt`, `sentAt`, `deliveredAt`, `seenAt`, `updatedAt`). The package calculates the status based on which fields are set, allowing for more granular control (useful for features like message history).

### Image Message Specific Changes

*   **`name`**: Removed.
*   **`size`**: Removed.
*   **`uri` -> `source`**: Renamed to highlight that the image source can be varied (local, remote, base64 string, etc.).

### File Message Specific Changes

*   **`size`**: No longer required.
*   **`uri` -> `source`**: Renamed to highlight that the file source can be varied (local, remote, etc.).

### Video Message Specific Changes

*   **`name`, `size`**: No longer required.
*   **`uri` -> `source`**: Renamed to highlight that the video source can be varied (local, remote, etc.).

### Audio Message Specific Changes

*   **`name`**: Removed.
*   **`mimeType`**: Removed.
*   **`size`**: No longer required.
*   **`duration`**: Now serialized as `int` in seconds (instead of milliseconds).
*   **`uri` -> `source`**: Renamed to highlight that the audio source can be varied (local, remote, etc.).

## User Model Changes

*   **`imageUri` -> `imageSource`**: Renamed to highlight that the image source can be varied (local, remote, base64 string, etc.).
*   **`firstName`, `lastName` -> `name`**: Simplified to a single field.
*   **`createdAt`**: Type changed from `int` to `DateTime`. It serializes to milliseconds UTC timestamp in JSON.

## `Chat` Widget Parameter Changes

*   **`messages`**: Replaced by the required `chatController` parameter. See the [Architecture](/docs/flutter/getting-started/architecture) section for details on controller.
*   **`onSendPressed`**: No longer exists. The alternative is the optional `onMessageSent` callback.
*   **`user`**: Replaced by two required parameters:
    *   `currentUserId` (`UserID`): The ID of the currently logged-in user (equivalent to v1's `user.id`).
    *   `resolveUser` (`Future<User> Function(UserID id)`): An async function that takes a user ID and returns the corresponding `User` object. v2 uses IDs internally and calls this function (with in-memory caching) whenever user data is needed.
