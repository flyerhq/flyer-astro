We are continuously working on expanding the documentation. If you have specific topics you'd like to see covered, or if you encounter challenges not addressed in the current guides, please let us know by [opening an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/flyerhq/flutter_chat_ui/issues)!

Future guides will include:

* Advanced message layouts using `ChatMessage` builders, group chats, etc.
* Creating and integrating custom message types
* Handling user typing indicators
* Internationalization (i18n) and localization (l10n)
* Scrolling to the specific message
* Customizing border radiuses
* Pagination
* Scroll behavior customization, including AI agent similar scroll
* Creating a custom composer and listening to its height changes


Your feedback helps us prioritize what to document next!
