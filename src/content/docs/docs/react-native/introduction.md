## Motivation ⏫

Building a chat UI should be simple. It might seem like just adding an input field and some message bubbles. But handling things like smooth animations, various message formats, and support for different platforms quickly becomes complex. Flyer Chat provides a strong base for creating any chat interface you imagine, whether it's for messaging apps, AI assistants, customer support, or something else. We wanted to create a chat UI that feels high-quality, with excellent performance and delightful animations - something often hard to achieve from scratch.
