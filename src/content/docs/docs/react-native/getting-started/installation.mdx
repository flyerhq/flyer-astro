# Installation

Get started with the React Native chat UI by installing the required packages in your project.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- **React Native 0.68+** - A React Native project set up and running
- **Node.js 16+** - Latest LTS version recommended
- **Package Manager** - npm, yarn, pnpm, or bun

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Core Dependencies

First, install the core packages that provide the foundation for your chat UI:

<PackageManagers
  pkg="flyer-chat-core react-native-chat-primitives react-native-chat-ui"
  pkgManagers={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm", "bun"]}
/>

### 2. Add Message Components

Install the message components you need for your chat:

**Text Messages:**

<PackageManagers
  pkg="flyer-chat-text-message"
  pkgManagers={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm", "bun"]}
/>

**Image Messages:**

<PackageManagers
  pkg="flyer-chat-image-message"
  pkgManagers={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm", "bun"]}
/>

**All Message Types:**

<PackageManagers
  pkg="flyer-chat-text-message flyer-chat-image-message"
  pkgManagers={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm", "bun"]}
/>

### 3. Install Required Dependencies

The chat UI depends on several React Native libraries for animations and gestures:

<PackageManagers
  pkg="react-native-gesture-handler react-native-reanimated react-native-svg"
  pkgManagers={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm", "bun"]}
/>

### 4. State Management

Install the reactive state management library:

<PackageManagers
  pkg="@legendapp/state"
  pkgManagers={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm", "bun"]}
/>

## Complete Installation

If you want to install everything at once:

<PackageManagers
  pkg="flyer-chat-core react-native-chat-primitives react-native-chat-ui flyer-chat-text-message flyer-chat-image-message @legendapp/state react-native-gesture-handler react-native-reanimated react-native-svg"
  pkgManagers={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm", "bun"]}
/>

## Platform Setup

### iOS Setup

After installing the dependencies, you'll need to install the iOS pods:

```shell
cd ios && pod install
```

### Android Setup

No additional setup is required for Android after installing the packages.

## Verification

Test your installation by importing the main Chat component:

```tsx
import { Chat } from "@flyerhq/react-native-chat-ui";
import { DefaultTheme } from "flyer-chat-core";

export function MyChat() {
  return (
    <Chat
      currentUserId="user-123"
      messages$={[]}
      onSendPress={(text) => console.log("Send:", text)}
      theme={DefaultTheme}
    />
  );
}
```
